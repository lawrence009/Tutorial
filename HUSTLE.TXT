Some people had asked for clarifications on hustle.  Probably I would be
considered an expert on the subject.  An earlier posting listed several
swing or hustle dances.

   Disco Swing
-- A catchall name, it can be any of several hustle dances - hustle, 4
count hustle, NY hustle (see descriptions below).

   Double Hustle
-- Refers to 3 people dancing NY hustle.  Usually 2 women and 1 man.
Unlike regular NY hustle, the basic used is the push-break, which has
been obsolete in hustle for 10 years.  In double hustle, the man
attempts to lead the 2 women at the same time.  It can be very
challenging to lead, and relies heavily on the women taking care of
themselves, since the man is just to busy to lead both women all the
time.  Can also be 2 men trading off leading 1 woman.  1 man and the
woman dance, then he hands her off to the other man, and they dance.
Then they switch again.  Having tried both myself, I prefer the version
with 1 woman and 2 men.  I have also seen 1 man dance with as many as 5
women at the same time, which is fairly difficult.  Also, the number of
leadable patterns is fairly low.

   Hustle
-- A catchall name.  At this time, it should refer to the mainstream
hustle dance, the NY Hustle.  It also is used to refer to any dance done
to disco or high energy music.

   Latin Hustle
-- A catchall name.  Back in the late 1970's, most disco dances were
called Latin Hustle or NY Hustle.  It was a marketing ploy, since people
wanted to learn to dance Latin Hustle or NY Hustle, and those dances
were in a constant state of change.

{The Latin Hustle I was introduced to was unique and not a catchall
{name.  It has been 1.5 years since  I did it but it involved a tap and
{a step before doing the more basic 4 count hustle foot pattern.  I
{learned it from the couple who won the Fred Astaire competition among
{instructors the last year Hustle was part of the Fred Astaire syllabus,
{1981.}

   Line Hustle
-- Is what they did in Saturday Night Fever.  If you change the styling
a bit, it becomes country & western line dances.  If you change it in a
different way, you get hip-hop line dances.  An old teacher of mine said
that line dances were popular in the early 1950's.  A convenient way for
dance teachers to make money.  About every 5 years, line dancing is
rediscovered.  Then the teachers brush off the line dances from last
time, change the styling a bit, add a customized step or 2, and, you are
current, again.  In the 22 years I've been dancing, this is the fourth
time I've seen line dances come back into style - line hustle in the
late 1970's, country-western in the early 1980's, and now both hip-hop
and country-western in the early 1990's.  I did enjoy line hustle when I
first came accross it about 1976, however I don't find it as challenging
as NY Hustle.

   New York Hustle
-- The definitive disco hustle dance.  Generally, if someone is dancing
hustle, they are dancing NY Hustle.  The dance has evolved greatly over
the years, through at least 6 major changes.  The earliest version
(1975?) looks like it was developed by women doing the woman's part in
West Coast Swing.  Originally it was a 6-count dance, then changed to 3
count about 1980.  About 1980 the dance had a rock-step in it, but that
was changed to a together-forward about 1982.  Many people believe they
are doing NY hustle, but they are doing older versions of it.  Dance
teachers often teach the obsolete versions.  Originally, NY Hustle was a
catch-all name, and some versions of it were identical to some versions
of Latin Hustle.  By about 1983, the other versions of hustle had faded
away, and what was left we called NY Hustle.  (I literally mean we -
there were only a few of us who kept the dance alive through the 1980's
in the San Francisco bay area).  The original count was &1 2 3 &4 5 6.
It is now just &1 2 3.  There are a few patterns which are &1 2 3 &4, or
&1 2 &3 4.  The count is not, and has never been, 1 2 &3, or 1 &2 3.
All the leads start on the & step, so what sense does it make to start
the lead half-way through the pattern?

   Rope Hustle
-- 2 dances.  The more common was a variation of merengue, actually.
There was also a different rope hustle which was NY Hustle in which the
man and woman were connected by small ropes, not hand to hand.  The man
led the woman through the ropes.  Of course, the number of moves were
limited, because it was so easy to get tangled in the ropes.   A very
strange dance.  I only tried it a couple of times.  It was really
impossible to keep the tension needed for leading.

   Sling Hustle
-- Also called swing hustle, also called 4-count hustle.  It is a 4
count variation on the NY Hustle of 1980.  All the steps take the same
length of time.  There is a rock-and in it, like the 3-count hustle of
1980.

   Street Hustle
-- Any hustle dance done by people who are not dance-studio trained, and
are not doing NY Hustle in a recognizable manner.  Similarly, the
designation of street dancer refers to a dancer who was not trained in a
dance studio.  Sometimes studio-dancer is used to refer to dancers
trained in dance studios, but that isn't common.
  The differences between street dancers and studio dancers have to do
with frame, lead, and patterns, and I won't get into that right now.

Dances not mentioned, and now extinct, include:
-- American hustle
-- Continental hustle
-- Tango hustle (merged into nightclub two-step - it is the traveling
   right turn).

VE>Just to add to the confusion: Hutchinson claims that the 3-count Hustle has
VE>as Quick-Slow rhythm. Eh, eh, eh, that is: Quick Triple-step.  He considers
VE>both the single step, the point-step and the triple-step (chasse) as a Slow.

HN>The best example I can think of where this difference becomes an issue is the
HN>double underarm turn.  In swing, the man leads the lady into an inside
HN>(counterclockwise) half turn on the first slow step, then he turns an inside
HN>half turn on the second slow step, and they both do the rock step together.  In
HN>hustle, the lady's turn is more or less the same, but the man has *half as
HN>much* time to complete his turn as the lady, since she turns on a slow count
HN>and he turns on a quick count.  Although the moves may appear the same to a
HN>spectator, they are danced very differently.

"Quick triple-step" is the same timing with different words; i.e., "1 2-&-3."

VE>By the way, my Arthur Murray teacher definitely counts the hustle as
VE>`one two three-and'.

Or, "& 1 2 3," which is the way it's more commonly counted in the
western part of the U.S. (We had an instructor from Utah teach hustle,
and it was really interesting watching him mentally adjusting to say "1
2 & 3" to us midwesterners each time.)

Which goes back to Mark Balzer's original question: my understanding is that
New York Hustle and California Hustle are the two common ways of counting Sling
Hustle, "1 2 & 3" and "& 1 2 3" respectively; the dance is the same.

Can any hustle experts confirm for us?

I'm afraid I don't qualify as a Hustle expert, but here's my $0.02:

Hustle is very popular here in the San Francisco Bay area, and "& 1 2 3"
is the only way I've ever heard it counted. It is interesting to note
that many beginners seem to do the "3 & 1" as a dotted eighth-sixteenth
rhythm, while the experienced dancers who look smooth dance it in even
eights. I'm not sure why.

Three-count hustle is very popular in the Greater Detroit area, too.
The Murray's studios teach "&1 2 3". However, I think most of the
social hustle dancers count it "1 2 &3" because that's the way Barry
Douglas has taught it, and he's been the strongest influence on
hustle in this area. When I was a beginner, I had an independent
teacher who couldn't decide which way he wanted to teach it and kept
going back and forth. It was hilariously confusing. Karen

Step-step-rock-step in swing is counted as 1-2,3-4,5,6. 3-count hustle
is counted And-1-2-3. See Henry's post.

4-count swing doesn't feel like swing to me, but works for hustle
because of the even accent on all 4 beats.

{Regarding Victor's comments on 3-count Hustle}:
You shouldn't count hustle like a single swing since the "slows" in
swing are 2 beats vs 1 in hustle. They are both 4/4 music, but if you
counted the 1-4 double time as 1-8, then I suppose the 1-2 3-4 5 6 matches
the 1 2 3 & of hustle. To me this is more confusing to try and compare
the rhythms since when you hear the music, the 4/4 rhythm of swing is
completely different than the 4/4 rhythm of hustle. In swing you do
1-2 3-4 5 6 to the hustle & 1 2 3 & 1 2 3 ...

Also, as Henry mentions, there is no rock step in Hustle, but sometimes
there is a side replace or cross replace (for the man). However, the side
replace is on and-one, not the three-and of double timed swing. Thus if you
count single swing as 1 2 3 & (instead of 1-2 3-4 5 6), you rock on
three-and instead of and-one.

Please don't do a rock step in hustle, particularly for the lady. The
together-forward on the and-one in Hustle moves forward. If you rock, you
move backwards instead of forwards, ripping the arm out of your partner's
shoulder.

I used to see the Sliding Doors in the 3-count Hustle a long time ago,
and I can't even remember exactly what it is now. However, there are
a couple of steps which are very similar which are commnly done. I suppose
the Sliding Door can be reinvented.

: 4-count Hustle is like the 3-count, but equal time for all steps.
: Ideal for doing swing with a woman who doesn't know swing.

The 4 count patterns and footwork is completely different. However, 4
count hustle is very easy to teach to someone who has never danced. It is
extinct in Northern California, as I haven't see it danced for a very long
time. It seems everyone here always teaches 3 count hustle, always as & 1
2 3 as opposed to the equivalent 1 2 3 &.

The man may do a side or cross on the & when the lady does a close or
"together". The reason this is called 3-count Hustle is because the
basic pattern in 3 beats, even though the music is 4 beats per measure.
Swing is 6 (or 8) counts per pattern, and the patterns end either at
the end of a measure or halfway in a measure.

I've never seen 3-count Hustle taught as 1 2 & 3, but all the uiuc.edu
dancers I've met dance the same way as here. The reasons I would call
& 1 2 3 "correct" are as follows. At the end of count 3 the movement is
stopped, so that makes a good point to cut the patterns. That would work
for &123 or 123&. However, with 12&3, the movement is under way, making it
difficult to teach a pattern since you can't start from a dead stop. A
together-forward, side-replace, cross-replace/step, or step-cross happens
on the quick-slow, which is at the start of the &123 rhythm, the end of
the 12&3 rhythm, but the 123& rhythm cuts this action in half. For the
man, which of side-replace, cross-replace/step, or step-cross occurs
depends on the following step, not the preceeding step. Therefore, it
makes more sense to teach this at the beginning of the step, making the
basic &123.

I've noticed the same thing. Nearly all beginners in Hustle dance the
&1 too fast, and look bad as a result.

I think teaching a 3 count pattern to 4 count music is somewhat
confusing, especially to beginners. Teachers wanting to drill the rhythm
into the students heads yell "ANDONE two three ANDONE ..." which ends up
being the incorrect a1 2 3 a1 2 3 instead of &1 2 3&1 2 3. Since you
can't close your feet and step forward all in a 1/16 note, people tend
to hop so thier feet move without the body. These people can improve
thier styling by slowing down, making the 3 & 1 more even, and using the
time on the & to plant the closing step firmly which provides power to
move on count 1.

From: jeff@trg.saic.com (Jeff Shepherd)

{Regarding Carl's and Chuck's previous comments, Jeff says}:
I think the easiest way to explain this is the difference between a
together-forward step and a rock-step.  For the lady to bring her right
foot together to the left foot and then take a forward step with the
left smoothes the dance out and gives more power to the &1.  Someone
doing a rock-step (right foot behind then replace weight on left) tends
to put a bounce in the step that wastes energy, interupts the flow, and
usually makes the lady pause too long on '&' so she has to rush to get
back on the rythym for 2 3.

I've done Hustle in the Boston and New York areas. In Boston, we usually
count 12&3 (although often use a "ball-change" as a prep step). In New
York, we counted &123. In Boston we use a lot of 4, 5, and 6 count
syncopations; in New York, mostly 6 count (e.g., "J-turn") or free form
single count. It's the same dance in both places, but styling is
different: in Boston we have mostly done a "rotating" style; in New York
it was all slotted (Boston is transitioning to slotted.)

I learned to Hustle in Detroit, and subsequently moved to Seattle, so
I've seen it from both "coasts."  I would definitely say that "one
two-and-three" is standard in Detroit, and "and-one two three" is
standard out here and in California.  However, I note other differences
as well, in footwork and the like.  For example, there seem to be more
rock-steps on the "and's" in Seattle, whereas in Detroit we do more
coaster steps, and we dance a slot dance in Detroit whereas the dance
seems to go all over the place out west.  And Arthur Murray of Detroit
does count it "one two-and-three."

In my limited experience, Hustle also seems to be named regionally. I've
heard 3-count Hustle referred to as "Sling Hustle", "Street Hustle",
"New York Hustle", and "Disco Hustle". There are regional differences
(and regional styling evolves over time), probably due to the creativity
of local dancers, but I think these are all the same dance.

My reply:
I agree Hustle is a different dance from swing. To the arguments Henry
has already stated, I would add that all the Hustle variations I've
heard of (in addition to the 3-count varieties, things like Rope, Latin,
Continental, and Tango Hustle) have more in common with each other, than
they do with the universe of swing variations (i.e., East, West, Shag,
etc.).

Why would Hustle be considered a form of swing? The main thing I think
they have in common, is that they can both be done to pop music. To some
extent, maybe the same people tend to like both, so you have things like
Hustle seminars at swing championships.

p.s. If considering Hustle a swing dance exposes more people to Hustle, I'm
all for it!

Michael Kheim, a professional instructor from San Diego area, told me
that Hustle was derived from West Coast Swing.  He demonstrated that it
was derived specifically from the sugar push pattern.   However, he
demonstrated this by showing the connection between WC swing and an
older version of Hustle, the New York Hustle.  A new question would then
be how the modern 3 count hustle evolved from the older New York Hustle.

Ever since Mark Balzer listed the various forms of swing and hustle some weeks
back, there's been lots of discussion on both kinds of dance.  However, one of
the implicit points in some of the posts is that hustle is a swing dance.  I
think there's a reasonable argument that this is not the case.

In swing dance, the strongest musical accent is on every even dance count, with
a lighter accent on every odd count:

Step           Trip--le  STEP    Trip--le  STEP    Rock  STEP
Dance Count    One   a   TWO     Three a   FOUR    Five  SIX

In eastern swing, your "swing" action comes on two and four, with a
little bit of compacting on those beats; in jive, hip and knee action
replace swinging, on the same beats.  In west coast swing, the man
particularly emphasizes count four by stepping toward his partner on it
(in six-count patterns).

In hustle, the accent is on every dance count (pardon my eastern timing,
all you westerners who like to count "&123", but it makes it easier to
talk about):

Step           STEP TRIP-le   STEP     STEP TRIP-le   STEP
Dance Count    ONE  TWO  and  THREE    ONE  TWO  and  THREE

I think it's reasonable to argue that a different rhythm (if we define
rhythm as a combination of time signature and accent patterns) combined
with a different character and a different syllabus can reasonably be
said to be a different dance.

What do people think?

Right. From the point of view of patterns, style, and technique, hustle
is not swing just like cha-cha is not swing. Yeah, they both are couples
dancing to 4/4 music, sometimes of similar style and tempo, but that's
no reason to classify them the same.

I agree about the accent in the music, but hustle does not have anything
at all like a triple step in swing. It simply confuses me to see "triple
step" used in hustle. It looks like you have just taken the 2&3 (or what
we would call 3&1) and called it a triple step, even though it doesn't
map onto any hustle patterns or footwork.

Latin Hustle (which I really don't know) does have a triple-step and it
done to the same rhythm as West Coast swing, so I suppose it could be
classified as swing. It is probably closer to west coast swing than the
modern 3 count hustle.

The flip side to having one man leading two women is to have two men
leading one woman.  Michael Kiem has taught a hustle class that did
both.  First he showed us moves that we could do to lead two women, and
in the second half of the workshop showed how two men could continually
keep handing off the lead and trading with the other man.  Someone came
up with the term 'Grand Theft Hustle'.  For awhile after that we would
get four ladies and five guys during a hustle and the extra guy would go
in, steal a girl and the now partnerless fellow would move to the next
couple and steal *that* lady away, and so on...  We would make games of
it, both trying to prevent our partner from being stolen and also seeing
how long two people could keep leading the same woman without letting
go.
